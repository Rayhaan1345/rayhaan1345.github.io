<h6> Hi!, Thank you for visiting my website! I was an intern at M42 Health Abu Dhabi where I worked under Dr. Shadab Khan and built an ML powered diabetes predictor model and research report. Also, have recently been offered a place as Research Intern at Brown University for Cancer therapeutic methods with AI. I am Studying in Grade 10 in Podar International (CIE), Seawoods, Navi Mumbai, India. I love to delve deeper into concepts regarding Mathematics, AI, especially Deep Learning and Cancer Biology.

If you're looking for collaborators for Robotics/ML projects, please feel free to get in touch!</h6>
